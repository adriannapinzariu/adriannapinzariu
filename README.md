<h1 align="center">Hello! I'm Adrianna Pinzariu ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>

I'm Adrianna, a passionate software engineer/quantitative researcher currently studying Computer Science at DePaul University. I find myself exploring new technologies and learning new concepts every day. I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow and expand my knowledge, particularly in OCaml.

</p>

Over the years, I've gained proficiency in **Java**, **Python**, **C++**, **JS/TS**, and **R**, but I've also worked on several projects using **C#**, **Rust**, **Go**, **PHP**, and **Scala**. Naturally, I picked up different web frameworks such as **Django**, **ASP.NET**, **Flask**, **FastAPI**, **Next.js**, **GoFiber**, **Express**, and many more to come! 

One of the areas I find particurly interesting is user authentication and exploring robust ways of protecting user privacy and security.
